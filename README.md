# README

Hey, this is a ReadMe to The Artist's Touch, or at least the backend. The project is effectively a one-page notes app specifically curated for artist's and creatives.

All instances of a class which has been called Meandering have a specific type:

Scraps

Inspirings

Uninspirings

Undecideds

Musings

Worlds

Techniques

Landscapes

Possibilities

Each of these represents a spcific type of content, which you can explore more of below.

An explanation:
This app is for the dreamers, the seekers, the boneshakers, the pioneers, the mavericks, and anyone who wants to add something to this amazing thing we call the world, feel free to plan building a ship here, too, if the world just is not big enough for you!!!

First, the Scraps:
This is where you put everything when it first comes into the app, kind of like a holding box of possible inspiration.
Next, you have the Uninspirings, the Inspirings, and the Undecideds. These are where you move the scraps once you've decided whether you were inspired (inspirings) by the scrap, uninspired (uninspirings), or you still don't know (undecideds).

Musings are the bridge to the rest of the framework, they are the infusions of your thoughts, your emotions, and your inspirations.

We'll skip over worlds for a second, and jump to techniques. The techniques are the way in which you know and discover to leave that artist's touch. This can include everything from painting, sculpting, and drawing, to programming, architecture design, and graphic design. And oh yeah, don't limit yourself here, really go for it in seeing what you can discover and maybe even invent.

Next, we come to landscapes. Now, landscapes are interesting, they are the ways things come together. Right here is a great opportunity to think out and concretize how things like what make your inspirings so inspring, what makes a great piece of architecture great, and even what makes the artist's touch so special.
Note, this may be the most important box.
Finally, we come to the possibilities, which could also be called constraints. This box is for what seems possible or not. You can just go ahead and throw this box away now!

Oh yeah, back to worlds!
These are all the ways in which you aspire to add that artist's touch. They are your dreams, and quite possibly what make you, you. Protect them at all costs!

Some technical specs, the forms were all implemented using Quilljs, an open source rich text editor, and 
the rest was made with plain javascript.  Authentication pending!!!

The backend was also made using the api configuration of Ruby on Rails, and Postgresql as the database!!!
